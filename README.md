# Scuttle Self-Balance robot
This project of mine was made with the support of [SCUTTLE™](https://www.scuttlerobot.org/). 

## About The Project
This project's subject is to make Scuttle robot balance it self on it's two wheels only editing it's default shape and use external IMU sensor. Main idea of this project comes from David Malawey who's Founder of Scuttle™ and I am the person who's made this idea come true. Before this project i have one project similar to this and it's called [LOTP_BalanceWheel](https://github.com/SMDHuman/BalanceWheel) and it's purpose is to make 3D Printed, small, stepper motor driven and Raspberry Pi Pico based two wheel self balancing robot.

## Requirements 
If you want to replicate this project on your own, you'll need;
1. Raspberry Pi Computer,
2. Scuttle Robot Base Parts,
3. MPU6050,
4. Custom 3D Printed Parts,
5. Basic Python Knowledge,
6. Basic understanding of PID Controller (in case of re-tuning PID)

With all of those you can easily remake or iterate on top of it.
